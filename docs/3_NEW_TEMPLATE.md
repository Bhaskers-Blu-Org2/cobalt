# 3. Cobalt Templating From Scratch

## 3.1 Overview

Per the [quickstart guide](./2_QUICK_START_GUIDE.md), we demonstrated that you can get pretty far with *Cobalt* by simply relying on any out of the box *Cobalt Infrastructure Template* or *CIT* (/kÉªt/). However, for several reasons, you may very well have unique infrastructure scenarios that require you to extract more use out of *Cobalt*. Therefore, we recommend building a *Cobalt Infrastructure Template* from scratch in order to cultivate a deeper understanding of what *Cobalt* has to offer.

A major core feature of *Cobalt* is that it offers a library of Terraform based *Cobalt Module*s that allow you to create and build-up *CIT*s. The act of creating a *CIT* from scratch will almost always involve thoughtfully choosing a mix of *Cobalt Module*s that already exist or were created by you. This section of the walkthrough will be an exercise in building *CIT*s for Cobalt. Happy templating! ðŸ˜„

## 3.2 Goals and Objectives

ðŸ”² Demonstrate how to create *Cobalt Modules* and *CIT*s that work for your custom infrastructure scenario.

ðŸ”² Improve your understanding of how to use existing *Cobalt Module*s and *CIT*s so that they can better work for you.

ðŸ”² Feel confident in moving forward to our next recommended section: *[Testing Cobalt Templates](./4_TEMPLATE_TESTING.md).*

## 3.3 Prerequisites

| Prereqs | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| [Quickstart Guide](./2_QUICK_START_GUIDE.md) | The quickstart guide provides all of the prerequisites you'll need to create your own *CIT* and run it.|
| [Terraform Modules](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/modules.html) | An introductory understanding of Terraform modules.|

## 3.4 Create and Run a New Template

*Cobalt Module*s primarily rely on [Terraform Modules](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/modules.html). The primary purpose of a Terraform Module as a feature is to encapsulate parts of your potential infrastructure configuration into reusable units. Here's a great example of Cobalt's existing [Azure service-plan](./../infra/modules/providers/azure/service-plan/README.md) module. It's being reused by several out of the box CIT's.

| Cobalt Module | Module Anatomy | Cobalt Infrastructure Template Using The Module |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Azure service-plan | pending png | pending png |

The above table demonstrates in a clear way how *Cobalt Infrastructure Templates* reap the natural benefits of the reusability that's offered by *Cobalt Modules*. This is possible because Terraform modules grant *Cobalt modules* reusability as a feature. Let's experience what it's like to create your own *CIT* from scratch by following the below steps:

### **Step 1:** Model your planned infrastructure

| New CIT Name | Description | Deployment Goal |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **az-hello-world-from-scratch** | A Cobalt Infrastructue Template that when ran creates a basic [Azure Function App](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview) within an [App Service Plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-hosting-plans) accompanied with [Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/). | <image src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10041279/67136958-a9d27600-f1f3-11e9-896c-d18f3a287de5.png" width="400" height="150"/> |

For demonstration purposes, we have already modeled the infrastructure. You will build a *CIT* and title it **az-hello-world-from-scratch** within your codebase. This CIT when ran will create and deploy the Azure resources listed in the description of the above table.

### **Step 2:** Plan your modular strategy

Once the decision of which infrastructure resources to deploy has been made, we recommending answering the following questions:

> QUESTION: **"Which portion of my planned infrastructure do I want to roll-up into a reusable module?"**

**ANSWER:** Currently, most Cobalt Modules are scoped to a very specific cloud infrastructure resource. In other words, modules encapsulate a configuration that targets a providers very specific cloud service product. For demonstration purposes, the Azure Function module we are creating follows this pattern, however, we also recommended continuing this pattern if new to scripting infrastructure as code.

> QUESTION: **"Does Cobalt have existing reusuable modules configured for any portion of my planned infrastructure?"**

**ANSWER:** At the time of this walkthrough, there are reusable modules for an Azure App Service Plan and Azure Storage, so you will use those to build part of your *CIT*. However, there is no current *Cobalt Module* configured for deploying an Azure Function. So, yes, a new Cobalt Module needs to be created. Let's design one!

### **Step 3:** Design Your Terraform Based *Cobalt Module*s

The first step of designing a *Cobalt Module* involves defining a Terraform module's 3 primary elements: input variables, output variables and resources. This will be all done via Terraform's [HCL language](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform), a language that grants developers the ability to target multiple cloud providers.

> NOTE: Documentation for the HCL language is partitioned by cloud provider. You will become very familiar with Terraform's cloud provider documentation as you learn to use and build your own modules and CITs.

1. Visit [Terraform Azure ARM Provider - Azure Function](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/r/function_app.html#example-usage-in-a-consumption-plan-) for insight into how we made design decisions for the Azure Function *Cobalt Module* in this walkthrough.

| Inputs | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| function_name  | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.. |
| datacenter_region | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.. |
| resource_group_name | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.. |
| app_service_plan_id | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.. |
| blob_storag_connection_string | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.. |

| Resources | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| azurerum_function_app | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.. |

### **Step 4:** Implement your chosen custom Terraform Based *Cobalt Module*s

Add the following diredtory to your code base
.....

### **Step 5:** Create a CIT that references your mix of Cobalt Modules

| New CIT Name | CIT Anatomy |
|----------|----------|
| az-hello-world-from-scratch |

### **Step 5:** Setup Local Environment Variables


### **Step 6:** Initialize a Terraform Remote Workspace


### **Step 7:** Run Your New Template


### **Step 8:** Validate Infrastructure Deployed Successfully


### **Final Step:** Teardown Infrastructure Resources


## Conclusion

As both the CITs and the Cobalt Modules that they are composed of continue to grow and become more robust, we welcome your contributions. *[A Link to contribution guidelines](pending)*
